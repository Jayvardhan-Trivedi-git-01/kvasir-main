Write a client server program using TCP where client sends two numbers and server responds with sum of them. [GTU-2014] (Surely an IMP!)



How to compile and run : 


Open up cmd/terminal(s), Change directory to the location where both java files resides.

Type : javac TCPServer          Press enter.

Type javac NumberInfo.java         Press enter.

If it shows error, try to solve it.

Type : javac TCPClient            Press enter. 

There should be two class files in the same directory on the successful compilation.

Now, run TCPServer class by typing : java TCPServer 5151

Type : java TCPClient localhost 5151   (Optional : Repeat this step for creating multiple clients)

See the output as shown below.
